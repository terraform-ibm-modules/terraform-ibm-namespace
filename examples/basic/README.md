# Basic example

A basic example that shows how to create multiple namespaces (projects) with custom annotations and labels in an OCP cluster.

The following resources are provisioned by this example:

- A new resource group, if an existing one is not passed in.
- A basic VPC.
- An OCP VPC cluster.

The namespace module then runs and creates project(s) in the OCP cluster.
